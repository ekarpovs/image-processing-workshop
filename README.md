# image-processing-workshop

Set of repositories for leaning, modeling and tuning various image-processing algorithms and tasks.

## The workshop includes following repositories

- [modules-and-worksheets](https://github.com/ekarpovs/modules-and-worksheets) - module - implementation of various operations (functions inside the module) and worksheet - configuration file that describe how to combine this operations for performing a whole task.
- [operation_loader](https://github.com/ekarpovs/operation_loader) - factory for load an function (operation) outside of package that used it. In this case modules and operations may be added without additional coding in a client programm.
- [gfsm](https://github.com/ekarpovs/gfsm) - generic finite state machine.
- [flow_converter](https://github.com/ekarpovs/flow_converter) - flow converter.
- [flow_runner](https://github.com/ekarpovs/flow_runner) - command line flow runner.
- [flow-storage](https://github.com/ekarpovs/flow_storage) - temporary storage for flow output.
- [flow-manager](https://github.com/ekarpovs/flow-manager) - (TILL IN DEVELOPMENT!!!) desktop application for creating, editing, debugging a flow by combination existing operations, and tuning their parameters.
